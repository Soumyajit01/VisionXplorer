# VisionXplorer Smart Glasses Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the VisionXplorer Smart Glasses project! This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and instructions for setting up and running the software.

## Project Overview

### Team Members
- Soumyajit Dass (Project Supervisor; Programming Lead)
- Garvit Murthal (Technical Head)
- Pritish Dash (Junior Developer)
- Labeeb Ahmad (Technical Researcher)

### Project Description
VisionXplorer is a project aimed at developing smart glasses that integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) into a transparent OLED display. The glasses are designed to be controlled using a Raspberry Pi as the controller. The project focuses on enhancing the user experience by providing a seamless interaction through the combination of hardware and software components.

## Software Details

### Requirements
- Python <3.12
- requirements.txt 

### Software Components
The software for the VisionXplorer Smart Glasses has been developed and is fully functional. It includes the following components:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Python Scripts

## Installation

1. Ensure that Python 3.12 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soumyajit01/VisionXplorer.git

## Run the GUI
```powershell
python visionxplorer.pyw
```
## Project Status
As of the last update, the hardware components for the smart glasses were not delivered on time, leading to the exclusion of the complete project from the science VAMMO Exhibition. However, the software is fully functional and ready for integration with the hardware.

## Future plans
We plan to continue the development of the VisionXplorer Smart Glasses project and present the complete solution in next year's exhibition.
